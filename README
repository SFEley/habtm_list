HabtmList
=========

This plugin arose out of a page on the Rails wiki:
http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/BetterHabtmList

The purpose is to allow position-based "acts_as_list"-like behavior in a has_and_belongs_to_many association.  Methods are included to move members up and down in the list.  

The original author of the technique, according to the wiki history, was "Matt."  Sorry, I don't know his last name; I'll give proper credit if he turns up to take it.  I refactored and fixed some bugs in the code, and now I'm simply putting it up on Github.  I'm claiming no ownership rights on this code whatsoever; use it any way you like.


Usage
-----
class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_and_belongs_to_many :products,
                          :order => 'position',
						  :list => true
end

-------
*first?(item)* - returns true if item is first in the list
